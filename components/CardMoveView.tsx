/* 
How this works:
We draw the board where 7 columns are shown, and with a margin of 10 between each card. The columns then have an identical width. The first row is the pile to pick up from, and the 4 sorted card placements. Bellow is the actual playspace, where cards are also stacked ontop of eachother. This view can then show an animation between two states.
